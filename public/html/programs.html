				<p>We launched our Bread of the Mighty Food Bank's Kids Cafe'in  October of 2007 with 4 locations serving snacks.  Today we have several programs and over 40 community partners.  Over 1 million meals and snacks have been served since 2007! In 2015-16, The Kid's Cafe provided 215,000 snacks to the children of our community. This program operates during the school year and works with existing after school programs to provide free drinks, fresh fruit and snacks to kids enrolled in a qualifying after school enrichment program during the school year. As the 2016-2017 school year begins,  BMFB will sponsor 14 Kid's Cafe sites which also provide mentoring, tutoring and homework assistance.</p>

				<p>The SNAP program provides individuals with help in applying for food stamps, Medicaid and cash assistance. SNAP offers nutrition assistance to millions of eligible, low-income individuals and families.  SNAP is the largest program in the domestic hunger safety net.  The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) works with state agencies, nutrition educators, neighborhoods and faith-based organizations to assist with eligibility for nutrition assistance so informed decisions can be made when applying for the program to access benefits. FNS also works with state partners and community retailers to improve program administration and ensure integrity.</p>
